# Web-Programming-Coursework
Coursework from my 1st year University 'Web Programming' module. I had 5 programming tasks with the theme of a wedding venue booking system. The first 4 tasks were programming the corresponding PHP files for the HTM files whcih were given: costs, capacity, details and catering. The last task was creating my own webpage to enable the user to pick a wedding venue using AJAX and JSON. The code files are not able to be downloaded and run because they connect to a database and I have removed the file with the its login details. If you would like to view the webpages, you can follow the links below:
